AuraFlow is a revolutionary Dev by Configuration platform designed to simplify and streamline the development process. By leveraging JSON Schema, AuraFlow enables developers to define their applications' elements, layout, rules, and interactions in a highly configurable manner. This approach not only accelerates development but also ensures consistency and flexibility across projects.

## Core Features

- **JSON Schema Configuration**: At the heart of AuraFlow is its core configuration system, which uses JSON Schema to specify the details of application elements, layouts, rules, and interactions. This system allows for a highly flexible and dynamic way to build applications.

- **Rules Engine**: AuraFlow incorporates a powerful rules engine that operates at various levels - element, component, and application. This engine enables developers to define complex logic and behaviors, ensuring that applications can adapt and respond intelligently to user inputs and other events.

- **Multi-Platform UI**: With support for React Native, Flutter, and web platforms, AuraFlow is designed to meet the needs of a diverse developer community. Whether you're building mobile, desktop, or web applications, AuraFlow provides the tools and flexibility to create stunning UIs that work seamlessly across devices.
